DND-5e

This is my personal github project for my dnd character sheets. Each section of the character sheet is broken down to individual files (e.g. about, lvl, xp, weapons, skills, etc). As my character changes I then update these files. The character.py script mainly just ties each of these files into one easy to read character sheet. There's also an abilities.py that does the does the same thing for each of the abilities in the abiliy folder as well as the gear.py which lists my armor and weapons. Obviously if you take different abilities you'll have to update the ability.py script as well to reflect this, but its pretty self explanitory. When I have time I'd like to eventually make some components of this via variables so that when I level up it will automatically update sections of my character sheet.
