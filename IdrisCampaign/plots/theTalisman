the absence of darkness
with a guided force
the seers clutch completes
and opens the doors


This talisman is used to open a secret door carved into the mountain.
The talisman must first be charged with the following spells:

1. light
2. true strike
3. mage hand

Each time one of the spells is cast and the talisman is visible,
the talisman will flicker with light and absorb the spell, no matter
who cast it and what the target is as long as the talisman is within
30 feet.
