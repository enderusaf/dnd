This is my electronic DND sheets.  Each folder is a character sheet.  Rather than having a single sheet,
each section of the sheet is broken out into files.  The files are:
  
abilities  
about  
ac  
character.py  
currentHP  
equipment  
geary.py  
groupLoot  
hitDice  
hp  
initiative  
loot  
lvl  
notes  
npcs  
places    
proficiency  
saves  
skills  
speed  
spells  
stats  
weaponProf  
weapons  
xp  

  
The data in each file is populated with the appropriate data for the character.
  
There are also scripts that can concatenate the files together to print out one nice looking character sheet.
  
This file is character.py and can be run in python via python character.py.  Or like myself you can just
create a nice alias such as "char" which will run the script. 
  
There is also a script to quickly print out the contents of you gear and equipment which is gear.py.
  
These scripts run in each character folder printing the information out for that character.
