After the party finishes the tomb, they will get this "random" encounter:
-  During a long rest at night
-  One member will notice a fire in the distance not to far from the group
--  Hopefully this will draw them to investigate
--  The fire is actually prestidigitation cast by a level 1, half-elf local.
--  It is meant to draw them over a frozen river, which will require a dex saving throw or they break through.
--  If they make it, they will require another dex saving throw or slip on the ice and fall prone.

The "enemy" group will consist of (1) level 1 wizard and two level 1 rangers.

300XP for encounter.

Prestidigitation

Firebolt:
You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged
spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A
flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.
This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th
level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

They are carrying nothing of value.
