Wherever the group goes, they get the feeling that someone is watching (and someone is).
The local group "The Idrah" which are refugees to this island as well.  They are upset at the 
defiling of the tomb of idris and have been watching the group and the settlement in order to
gague their intentions.  The last attack on their group was from young teens of their tribe
who attacked out of rage when they saw the sword of idris.  Should the group capture any of the tribe members,
they may tell them about who they are and why they attacked.  They may even try to broker a peace.  The
Idrian Trading Company, Lord Grenworth and the ambassador however, will have none of it.  They will spin a tale
of how they are heretics and that they need to be purged.
