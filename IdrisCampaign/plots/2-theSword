The amabbassador will be impressed by the groups actions and seek their audience.  After the ambassador "praises" them of
their deeds, he will notice the sword being carried by the group.  He will offer to purchase it for the price of 1K gold.
If asked about it's history he will make up a story how the symbols on on the sword are that of an ancient and long thought
purged cult of demon worshippers.  He of course is lying.  He will ask them to slaughter any of this "cult" that they come
in contact with with the promise of a great reward when the task is complete.
