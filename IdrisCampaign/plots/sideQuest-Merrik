Merrik will ask the adventureres to find his sons, or more importantly to find the set of armor he was
creating for the Lord Grenworth.

The group can potentially find the remains of the brothers frozen in their tents.  It looks as though they fell
into the river and tried to warm up.  It looks like some passing by creatures may have chewed on their flesh some.

-  When returning with the armor bandits may attack them in attempt to steal the armor for their boss and rival
black/bladesmith (Eriks).
